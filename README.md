One of the tasks for code check (application process)
The idea of the exercise was to create handler for json - and display data in sortable table
with searchbox - which will match against 'id','name' and 'sku'. I was asked to use Vue.js
with this challange, as picking up new framework was tested. Vue.js file is included in repo.
